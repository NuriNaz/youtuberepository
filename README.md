#  YouTube Real-Time Text Analysis Case Study

##  Project Overview
This project performs a **real-time YouTube data analytics and text analysis case study** to uncover insights about audience engagement, comment sentiments, and trending behaviors.  
It combines **data analytics, natural language processing (NLP)**, and **visualization** to understand how viewers react to different categories and creators on YouTube.

---

##  Objectives
- Combine multiple YouTube category datasets into one analytics-ready dataframe.
- Analyze **views, likes, dislikes, and engagement rates**.
- Perform **Sentiment Analysis** on user comments using **VADER (NLTK)**.
- Generate **Word Clouds** for positive and negative sentiments.
- Conduct **Emoji Analysis** to identify common emotional reactions.
- Visualize insights using **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**.

---

##  Key Insights
- Extracted dominant **positive and negative sentiments** from thousands of YouTube comments.  
- Identified **top-used emojis** to gauge user emotion and reaction intensity.  
- Visualized correlations between **views, likes, and dislikes**, revealing engagement trends.  
- Category-level boxplots showed which video categories receive the **highest engagement**.  
- Created interactive visualizations with **Plotly** to explore trends across channels.

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
- Loaded multiple `.csv` files containing YouTube metadata and comments.
- Merged datasets into one large DataFrame using `pandas.concat`.
- Cleaned text data and standardized column names.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Used **VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer** from `nltk` to compute polarity scores.
- Added a new column `polarity` to represent positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
- Visualized distribution of sentiment across categories.

### 3. Word Cloud Analysis
- Created **Word Clouds** for:
  - Positive comments
  - Negative comments
- Used `WordCloud` and `STOPWORDS` to visualize the most frequent words per sentiment.

### 4. Emoji Analysis
- Extracted emojis from each comment using the `emoji` library.
- Counted occurrences using `Counter` and plotted the **Top 10 emojis** with `Plotly`.
- Interpreted emojis to reflect audience mood and engagement tone.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized **likes, views, and dislikes** relationships using:
  - Boxplots for engagement per category
  - Regression plots for `views` vs `likes`
  - Correlation heatmaps
- Used **Plotly** for interactive charts showing top-performing channels.

---

## Results & Insights
- Most comments expressed **positive sentiment**, showing strong audience engagement.  
- **üòÇ**, **‚ù§Ô∏è**, and **üî•** emerged as the most frequently used emojis ‚Äî indicating humor, love, and excitement.  
- Categories like **Music**, **Entertainment**, and **Gaming** received the **highest likes-to-views ratio**.  
- Found strong positive correlation between **views and likes**, confirming content quality drives engagement.

## Conclusion

This YouTube Real-Time Text Analysis project demonstrates the power of data analytics and NLP in understanding **audience behavior and engagement patterns**.

By combining structured data (views, likes, dislikes) with unstructured text data (comments and emojis), the analysis revealed valuable insights:

- Most viewers expressed **positive sentiment**, indicating strong satisfaction and enjoyment with the content.  
- **Emoji usage** reinforced emotional engagement ‚Äî emojis like üòÇ, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üî•, and üòç dominated, showing humor, love, and excitement as common reactions.  
- The **Music**, **Entertainment**, and **Gaming** categories generated the highest engagement, both in sentiment and numeric metrics (likes and views).  
- A clear **positive correlation** exists between likes and views ‚Äî suggesting that higher visibility directly influences positive feedback.  
- The **Word Cloud analysis** highlighted keywords around appreciation (‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúawesome‚Äù), confirming audience enthusiasm toward popular videos.  
- **Negative comments** were often short and focused on specific content or performance issues, offering useful feedback for creators.

### Key Takeaway
The project illustrates how **text analytics and visualization** can transform social media data into actionable insights.  
With tools like `nltk`, `wordcloud`, `emoji`, and `plotly`, even unstructured YouTube comments can be quantified to measure audience mood and content success.
